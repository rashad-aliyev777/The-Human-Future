        <p>The concept of planets has evolved throughout its history, from divine lights of antiquity to earthly objects in the scientific age. <br /> The concept has expanded to encompass not only worlds within the Solar System but also those within myriad other extrasolar systems.

            <br /> The agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a planet, as opposed to other objects orbiting the Sun, has changed several times. <br /> It previously included asteroids, moons, and dwarf planets like Pluto. Even today, some disagreements persist.

             <br /> The five classical planets of the Solar System, visible to the naked eye, have been known since ancient times and have had a significant impact on mythology, religious cosmology, and ancient astronomy. <br /> In antiquity, astronomers observed certain lights moving across the sky, in contrast to the "fixed stars" that maintained a consistent relative position. <br /> Ancient Greeks referred to these lights as "πλάνητες ἀστέρες" (planētes asteres, "wandering stars") or simply "πλανῆται" (planētai, "wanderers"), from which the modern word "planet" is derived.

              <br /> In ancient Greece, China, Babylon, and virtually all pre-modern civilizations, it was widely believed that Earth occupied the center of the Universe and that all the "planets" revolved around it. <br /> This perception stemmed from stars and planets appearing to orbit Earth each day, combined with the intuitive sense that Earth was solid, stable, and motionless.</p>
